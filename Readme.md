# A Git talk #

I will give this talk at some point at the [PitLab](http://pitlab.itu.dk). This readme is an overview over the talk; it is essentially a list of commands which are executed on the working tree.

## Getting an overview ##

```git clone```

```git status```

```git diff```

```git log```

## Editing the index ##

```git commit```

```git push```

```git pull```

```git fetch```

## Reparing things ##

```git checkout```

```git revert```

```git reset```

## Branches and fancy stuff ##

```git branch```

```git merge```

```git rebase```

## Maybe some extras, if time permits ##

```git bisect```

and finally the ```.gitignore``` file.
